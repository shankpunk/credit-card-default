# credit-card-default
Wrote code to predict if a person will have credit card defaults or not.

Used Random Forest to classify the data. Fine tuned the model but there wasn't a huge jump in accuracy. 

The number of Defaults were really low so used oversampling to increase the Defaults. 

Missing values were replaced with their mean value.
